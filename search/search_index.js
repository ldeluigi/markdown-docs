The date appears automatically at the bottom if a git history is found. See the docs for more information. git-authors-plugin : Displays git authors of the page. Authors appear automatically at the bottom if a git history is found. See the docs for more information. notebooks : .ipynb file rendering support. Usage You can use markdown-docs both as a GitHub Acton or a Docker builder stage inside your dockerfile. As GitHub Action To use markdown-docs as a GitHub Action, use the following syntax in your workflow: - name : Generate HTML from Markdown uses : ldeluigi/markdown-docs@latest with : src : doc dst : generated This means that every markdown file inside the doc folder in the current workspace will be converted and mapped to a corresponding HTML file inside the generated directory. You can pass . as src to search the entire repo for markdown files. dst folder will be emptied before generation. Additional information In order to make the \"last edit date\" plugin work you need to clone the full history of your documentation inside your CI. With GitHub actions this can be done using the option fetch-depth: 0 with the actions/checkout@v3 step. Complete usage example with all the parameters - name : Generate HTML from Markdown uses : ldeluigi/markdown-docs@latest with : src : doc dst : generated title : Markdown Docs language : en icon : library primary-color : indigo secondary-color : indigo hide-repository : false Additional parameters info title is an optional parameter (defaults to the name of the repository, such as ldeluigi/markdown-docs or Documentation if no repo is detected) that sets the title displayed at the top of the documentation website. language is an optional paramater (defaults to en ) that allows to change language features and search features . icon is an optional parameter (defaults to library ) that selects the main top-left icon of the documentation website. Can be one of the icons from Material Design Icons . primary-color is an optional parameter (defaults to indigo ) that selects the main color of the documentation website. For more information, see the docs . secondary-color is an optional parameter (defaults to indigo ) that selects the accent color of the documentation website. For more information, see the docs . hide-repository is an optional parameter (defaults to false ) that, if set to true , will hide every reference to the source repo. Useful for private repos. As Docker builder To use markdown-docs as a Docker builder stage use the following syntax in your Dockerfile: FROM deloo/markdown-docs AS builder COPY docs/ /home/src ENV WORKSPACE = /home RUN makedocs \"src\" \"dst\" FROM ... COPY --from = builder /home/dst /var/www/static/ This means that first docker stage creates a container where it runs the makedocs script, then will copy the resulting, generated HTML files in the production image, specifically in /var/www/static . This can be useful for your static website hosting. See the Wiki for more examples. Environment variables There are some environment variables that control the behaviour of the builder. These are: ENV WORKSPACE = /home # Optionals (with their default values) ENV TITLE = Markdown Docs ENV LANGUAGE = en ENV ICON = library ENV PRIMARY_COLOR = indigo ENV SECONDARY_COLOR = indigo * WORKSPACE selects the path in which the main script is run. This path should be the root of your working directory, inside which there are both the source folder and the destination folder. * TITLE , LANGUAGE , ICON , PRIMARY_COLOR , SECONDARY_COLOR are all described in this section . Notes about documenting your software The idea behind markdown-docs is that all the documentation that can be written in separate files from the code should be mantained like the code documentation, that is thinking about the content and not the appearence. In addition, some of the most important tools for documentation are UML diagrams. In particular, one of the most maintainable way to draw UMLs is PlantUML , which can generate UML diagrams for a text specification. One of the most important features of markdown-docs is the support of PlantUML syntax embedded inside documentation sources, in Markdown.
