Usage You can use markdown-docs both as a GitHub Acton or a Docker builder stage inside your dockerfile. As GitHub Action To use markdown-docs as a GitHub Action, use the following syntax in your workflow: - name : Generate HTML from Markdown uses : ldeluigi/markdown-docs@master with : src : doc dst : generated This means that every markdown file inside the doc folder in the current workspace will be converted and mapped to a corresponding HTML file inside the generated directory. You can pass . as src to search the entire repo for markdown files. dst folder will be emptied before generation. As Docker builder To use markdown-docs as a Docker builder stage use the following syntax in your Dockerfile: FROM deloo/markdown-docs AS builder COPY docs/ /home/src ENV WORKSPACE = /home RUN makedocs \"src\" \"dst\" FROM ... COPY --from = builder /home/dst /var/www/static/ This means that first docker stage creates a container where it runs the makedocs script, then will copy the resulting, generated HTML files in the production image, specifically in /var/www/static . This can be useful for your static website hosting. See the Wiki for more examples. Notes about documenting your software The idea behind markdown-docs is that all the documentation that can be written in separate files from the code should be mantained like the code documentation, that is thinking about the content and not the appearence. In addition, some of the most important tools for documentation are UML diagrams. In particular, one of the most maintainable way to draw UMLs is PlantUML , which can generate UML diagrams for a text specification. One of the most important features of markdown-docs is the support of PlantUML syntax embedded inside documentation sources, in Markdown.","title":"Markdown Docs"},{"location":"index.html#markdown-docs","text":"The same readme, built with this: here !
